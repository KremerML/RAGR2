       "   'summary_tokenized': \"The play begins in front of the palace of Thebes , with Dionysus telling the story of his origin and his reasons for visiting the city . Dionysus explains that he was born prematurely , when Hera made Zeus send down a lightning bolt , killing the pregnant Semele and causing the birth . Some in Thebes , he notes , don’t believe this story . In fact , Semele’s sisters — Autonoe , Agave , and Ino – claim it is a lie intended to cover up the fact that Semele became pregnant by some mortal ; they say Zeus ' lightning was a punishment for the lie . Dionysus reveals that he has driven the women of the city mad , including his three aunts , and has led them into the mountains to observe his ritual festivities . He explains that while he is appearing , at the moment , disguised as a mortal , he will vindicate his mother by appearing before all of Thebes as a god , the son of Zeus , and establishing his permanent cult of followers . Dionysus exits to go into the mountains , and the chorus enters . They dance and sing , celebrating Dionysus and adding details of his birth and the Dionysian rites . Then Tiresias , the blind and elderly seer , appears . He knocks on the palace doors and calls for Cadmus , the founder and former king of Thebes . The two venerable old men are planning to join the revelry in the mountains when Cadmus’ grandson Pentheus , the current king , enters . Disgusted to find the two old men in festival dress , he scolds them and orders his soldiers to arrest anyone engaging in Dionysian worship . He wants the foreigner , whom he does n't recognize as Dionysus in disguise , to be captured . Pentheus intends to have him stoned to death . The guards soon return with Dionysus himself . His hands are bound , and he is disguised as a priest and the leader of the Asian Maenads . Pentheus questions him , his words showing both his skepticism and his interest in the Dionysian rites . Dionysus ' answers keep the meaning hidden , only hinting at the truth Pentheus can not see . Infuriated , Pentheus has him taken away in chains and locked up in his stable , where the guards attach the other end of their prisoner s chains to the hooves of an angry bull . Dionysus , being a god and powerful , breaks free and creates more havoc , razing the palace with an earthquake and fire . Dionysus is confronting Pentheus , when a herdsman arrives from the top of Mount Cithaeron , where he had been herding his grazing cattle . He reports that he found women on the mountain behaving strangely . First , some were sleeping quietly , or drinking wine while listening to flute music . Some were going into the woods in pursuit of love . Some women were putting snakes in their hair , some were suckling wild wolves and gazelles . Some caused water , wine or milk to spring up from the ground . One woman had honey oozing from her thyrsus . The herdsmen and the shepherds made a plan to capture one particular celebrant , Pentheus ' mother . But when they jumped out of hiding to grab her , the tables were turned , and the women pursued the men . The men escaped , but their cattle were not so fortunate , as the women fell upon the animals , ripping them to shreds with their bare hands . The women carried on , plundering two villages that were further down the mountain , stealing bronze , iron and even babies . When villagers attempted to fight back , the women drove them off using only their ceremonial staffs of fennel . They then returned to the mountain top and washed up , as snakes licked them clean . Dionysus , still in disguise , persuades Pentheus to forgo his plan to defeat and massacre the women with an armed force . He says it would first be better to spy on them , while disguised as a female Maenad to avoid detection . Dionysus dresses Pentheus as a woman , giving him a thyrsus and fawn skins , and leads him out of the house . At this point , Pentheus appears not wholly sane , as he thinks he sees two suns in the sky , and believes he now has the strength to rip up mountains with his bare hands . He has also begun to see through Dionysus ' mortal disguise , perceiving horns coming out of the god s head . They exit . A messenger arrives to report that once they reached Mount Cithaeron , Pentheus wanted to climb an evergreen tree to get a better view and the stranger used divine power to bend down the tall tree and place the king in its highest branches . Then Dionysus , revealing himself , called out to his followers and pointed out the man in the tree . This drove the Maenads wild . Led by Agave , his mother , they forced the trapped Pentheus down from the tree top , ripped off his limbs , his head , and tore his body into pieces . After the messenger has relayed this news , Agave arrives , carrying her son s head . In her possessed state , she believes it is the head of a mountain lion . She proudly displays it to her father , Cadmus , and is confused when he does not delight in her trophy , and his face instead contorts in horror . Agave then calls out for Pentheus to come marvel at her feat , and nail the head above her door so she can show it to all of Thebes . But Dionysus ' possession begins to wear off , and Cadmus forces her to recognize what she s done . As the play ends , the corpse of Pentheus is reassembled , as well as is possible , the royal family is devastated and destroyed . Agave and her sisters are sent into exile , and Dionysus decrees that Cadmus and his wife Harmonia will be turned into snakes and lead a barbarian horde to plunder the cities of Hellas .\"},\n",

       "   'summary_tokenized': 'The play adapts the story of ChitrÄ\\x81ngadÄ\\x81 and Arjuna from the Mahabarata and begins with Chitra beginning a conversation with Madana , the god of love , and Vasanta , the god of springtime and eternal youth . They ask Chitra who she is and what is bothering her , to which she replies that she is the daughter of the king of Manipur and has been raised like a boy as her father had no male heir . She is a great warrior and hero despite being born as a woman , but has never had the chance to truly live as a woman or learn how to use feminine wiles . Chitra explains that she had met the warrior hero Arjuna after seeing him in the forest while she was hunting for game . Despite knowing that he had pledged several vows including one for twelve years of celibacy , Chitra fell instantly in love with him . The following day she tried to approach him and plead her case , but Arjuna turned her away due to his vows . Chitra begs with the two gods to give her a day of perfect beauty so she can win over Arjuna and have just one night of love with him . Moved by her pleas , the two gods give her not just one day but an entire year to spend with Arjuna . The next scene opens with Arjuna marveling over the perfect beauty he has seen . Chitra , the beauty of which he mentions , enters and Arjuna immediately strikes up a conversation with her . He requests to know what she is searching for , to which Chitra coyly replies that she is seeking the man of her desires . The two go back and forth until Chitra admits that she is looking for him , which prompts Arjuna to say that he will no longer hold to his vows of chastity . Chitra finds that rather than make her happy , hearing this makes her extremely unhappy since he is not falling for her true self and tells him not to offer his heart to an illusion . Later the next day , Chitra admits to Madana and Vasanta that she had spurned Arjuna due to him falling for what she saw as a false image of herself . The two gods scold her as they had only given her what she had asked of them . Chitra replies that despite their gift , she sees the perfect beauty as a being separate from herself and that even if she had slept with Arjuna , it would not be the true her that he loved- only her beauty . Vasanta advises Chitra to go to Arjuna and spend the year with him and that at the year s end Arjuna will be able to embrace the true Chitra once the spell of perfect beauty is gone . Chitra does so , but throughout their year together she assumes that Arjuna will not love her once the year is up . After much time has passed , Arjuna begins to grow restless and longs to hunt once again . He also begins to ask Chitra questions about her past , wondering if she has anyone at home that is missing her . Chitra remarks that she has no past and that she s as transient as a drop of dew , which upsets Arjuna . With the year approaching its end , Chitra asks that the two gods make her last night her most beautiful , which they do . However around the same time Arjuna hears tales of the warrior Princess Chitra and begins to wonder what she might be like . Never having told him her name , Chitra assures Arjuna that he would never have noticed Chitra if he had passed by her and tries to coax him into bed . Arjuna declines , saying that some villagers have informed him that Maripur is under attack . Chitra assures him that the city is well protected , but to no avail . Arjuna s mind is occupied with thoughts of the princess , to which Chitra bitterly asks if he would love her more if she were like the Princess Chitra he admires . Arjuna replies that since she has always kept her true self a secret , he has never truly grown to love her as much as he could and that his love is incomplete . Noticing that this upsets her , Arjuna tries to console his companion . The play ends with Chitra finally admitting to Arjuna that she is the princess of which he spoke of and that she begged for beauty in order to win him over . She admits that she is not a perfect beauty , but that if he would accept her then she would remain with him forever . Chitra also admits that she is pregnant with his son . Arjuna meets this news with joy and states that his life is truly full .'},\n",

      "page_content='independent evaluation where raters assessed the quality of individual report findings. Prior to performing the\\nfinal evaluation, we iterated upon the instructions for the raters and calibrated their grades using a pilot set\\nof 25 cases that were distinct from the evaluation set. Side-by-side evaluation was performed for all 246 cases,\\nwhere each case was rated by a single radiologist randomly selected from a pool of four. For independent\\nevaluation, each of the four radiologists independently annotated findings generated by three Med-PaLM M\\nmodel variants (12B, 84B, and 562B) for every case in the evaluation set. Radiologists were blind to the\\nsource of the report findings for all evaluation tasks, and the reports were presented in a randomized order.\\nSide-by-side evaluation The input to each side-by-side evaluation was a single chest X-ray, along with the\\n“indication” section from the MIMIC-CXR study. Four alternative options for the “findings” section of the\\nreport were shown to raters as depicted in Figure A.3. The four alternative “findings” sections corresponded\\nto the dataset reference report’s findings, and findings generated by three Med-PaLM M model variants (12B,\\n84B, 562B). Raters were asked to rank the four alternative findings based on their overall quality using their\\nbest clinical judgement.\\nIndependent evaluation For independent evaluation, raters were also presented with a single chest X-ray,\\nalong with the indication and reference report’s findings from the MIMIC-CXR study (marked explicitly as\\nsuch), but this time only a single findings paragraph generated by Med-PaLM M as shown in Figure A.4.\\nRaters were asked to assess the quality of the Med-PaLM M generated findings in the presence of the reference\\ninputs provided and their own judgement of the chest X-ray image. The rating schema proposed in Yu et al.\\n[60] served as inspiration for our evaluation task design.\\nFirst, raters assessed whether the quality and view of the provided image were sufficient to perform the\\nevaluation task fully. Next, they annotated all passages in the model-generated findings that they disagreed\\nwith (errors), and all missing parts (omissions). Raters categorized each error passage by its type (no finding,\\nincorrect finding location, incorrect severity, reference to non-existent view or prior study), assessed its clinical\\nsignificance, and suggested alternative text to replace the selected passage. Likewise, for each omission, raters\\nspecified a passage that should have been included and determined if the omission had any clinical significance.\\n6 Results\\nHere we present results across the three different evaluation setups introduced in Section 5.\\n6.1 Med-PaLM M performs near or exceeding SOTA on all MultiMedBench tasks\\nMed-PaLM M performance versus baselines We compared Med-PaLM M with two baselines:\\n•prior SOTA specialist models for each of the MultiMedBench tasks\\n•a baseline generalist model (PaLM-E 84B) without any biomedical domain finetuning. We used this\\nmodel size variant (and not PaLM-E 562B) due to compute constraints.\\nResults are summarized in Table 2. Across MultiMedBench tasks, Med-PaLM M’s best result (across three\\nmodel sizes) exceeded prior SOTA results on 5 out of 12 tasks (for two tasks, we were unable to find a prior\\nSOTA comparable to our setup) while being competitive on the rest. Notably, these results were achieved with\\na generalist model using the same set of model weights without any task-specific architecture customization\\nor optimization.\\nOn medical question answering tasks, we compared against the SOTA Med-PaLM 2 results [61] and observed\\nhigher performance of Med-PaLM 2. However, when compared to the baseline PaLM model on which\\nMed-PaLM M was built, Med-PaLM M outperformed the previous best PaLM results [9] by a large margin in\\nthe same few-shot setting on all three question answering datasets.\\nFurther, when compared to PaLM-E 84B as a generalist baseline without biomedical domain finetuning, Med-\\nPaLM M exhibited performance improvements on all 14 tasks often by a significant margin, demonstrating the\\nimportance of domain adaptation. Taken together, these results illustrate the strong capabilities of Med-PaLM\\nM as a generalist biomedical AI model. We further describe the results in detail for each of the individual\\ntasks in Section A.3.\\n|9' metadata={'source': '/Users/kremerr/Documents/GitHub/RARR/archive/2307.14334.pdf', 'page': 8}\n"
